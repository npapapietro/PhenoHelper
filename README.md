# PhenoHelper

This project is a long process of multiple smaller projects all binded together. It is still far from complete. The goal is to develop a program that takes just particle input and does all the leg work in developing a generalized Lagrangian, calculating the RGEs and then supporting numerical solving and plotting of solutions.

## Getting Started

So far I've only tested this on Debian/Ubuntu.

### Prerequisites

There are only two needed external libraries:
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - Needed for the linear algebra support
[Boost](http://www.boost.org/) - Needed for rational number support and several other things.


### Installing

Basic installation so far. Git clone and cd into the library then run
```
cmake .
```

And then 

```
make
```

## Running the tests

TBA
